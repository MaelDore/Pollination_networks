## Research Article

This repository contains the R scripts and data used to carry analyses for this research article:

__Doré et al., 2020 - Relative effects of anthropogenic pressures, climate, and sampling design on the structure of pollination networks at the global scale.__ [Link to be posted]()

In this study, we conducted a synthetic analysis that assesses the relative impact of anthropogenic pressures, climatic variability, and sampling heterogeneity on the richness and levels of generalism in pollination networks. We analyzed an extensive dataset, comprising 295 networks over 123 locations all over the world, and reporting over 50 000 interactions between flowering plant species and their insect visitors.

## Contents

 - [:file\_folder: **Data**](Data/) directory contains the network datasets used in the analyses.
 
  - [:file\_folder: **Figures**](Figures/) directory contains all the intermediate figures generated by the scripts showing effects of each explanatory variable on each response variable.
  
   - [:file\_folder: **Final_Figures**](Final_Figures/) directory contains the final figures displayed in the article.
   
   - [:file\_folder: **Models_outputs**](Models_outputs/) directory contains the summary of model outputs for the models presented in the main text.

   - [:file\_folder: **Models_outputs_no_sampling**](Models_outputs_no_sampling/) directory contains the summary of model outputs for the models run without sampling variables. They are used for analyses and figures presented in SM6.

   - [:file\_folder: **Models_outputs_with_polar**](Models_outputs_with_polar/) directory contains the summary of model outputs for the models run with additional three arctic networks. They are used for analyses and figures presented in SM5.
   
  - [:file\_folder: **Scripts**](Scripts/) directory contains the scripts used to run the analyses presented in the main text
    - [:file\_folder: **Scripts/SM**](Scripts/SM/) sub-directory contains the scripts used to run the analyses presented in the Supplementary
          
  - [:file\_folder: **SM_Figures**](SM_Figures/) directory contains all the intermediate figures generated by the scripts for analyses presented in Supplementary. These figures display beta-coefficients associated with each model.
      
  - [:file\_folder: **SM_Final_figures**](SM_Final_figures/) directory contains the final figures displayed in the Supplementary.
    
  - [:file\_folder: **SM_Tables**](SM_Tables/) directory contains the tables displayed in the Supplementary.
   
  - [:file\_folder: **SM_Final_figures**](SM_Final_figures/) directory contains the tables displayed in the Supplementary.
    
  - [:file\_folder: **Tables**](Tables/) directory contains the tables displayed in the main text.

## How to run it

This research has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To run the analyses, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the entire project as a `.zip` from [this URL](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping:
  
  - Open the `Pollination_networks.Rproj` file, found at the root of the project, in RStudio

  - Run sequentially the scripts found in the [:file\_folder: **Scripts**](Scripts/) folder. It will rebuild the model outputs and figures presented in the main text of the article.
  
  - Run sequentially the scripts found in the [:file\_folder: **Scripts/SM**](Scripts/SM/) sub-folder. It will rebuild the model outputs and figures presented in the Supplementaries of the article.
