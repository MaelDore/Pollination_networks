## Research Article

This repository contains the code and data used to carry analyses for this research article:

__Doré et al., 2020 - Relative effects of anthropogenic pressures, climate, and sampling design on the structure of pollination networks at the global scale.__ [Link to be posted]()

All content is available [here](https://github.com/MaelDore/Pollination_networks).


## Contents

 - [:file\_folder: **Data**](Data/) directory contains the network datasets used in the analyses.
 
  - [:file\_folder: **Figures**](Figures/) directory contains all the intermediate figures generated by the scripts showing effects of each explanatory variable on each response variable.
  
   - [:file\_folder: **Final_Figures**](Final_Figures/) directory contains the final figures displayed in the article.
   
   - [:file\_folder: **Models_outputs**](Models_outputs/) directory contains the summary of model outputs for the models presented in the main text.

   - [:file\_folder: **Models_outputs_no_sampling**](Models_outputs_no_sampling/) directory contains the summary of model outputs for the models run without sampling variables. They are used for analyses and figures presented in SM6.

   - [:file\_folder: **Models_outputs_with_polar**](Models_outputs_with_polar/) directory contains the summary of model outputs for the models run with additional three arctic networks. They are used for analyses and figures presented in SM5.
   
  - [:file\_folder: **Scripts**](Scripts/) directory contains the scripts used to run the analyses presented in the main text
    - [:file\_folder: **Scripts/SM**](Scripts/SM/) sub-directory contains the scripts used to run the analyses presented in the Supplementary
          
  - [:file\_folder: **SM_Figures**](SM_Figures/) directory contains all the intermediate figures generated by the scripts for analyses presented in Supplementary. These figures display beta-coefficients associated with each model.
      
  - [:file\_folder: **SM_Final_figures**](SM_Final_figures/) directory contains the final figures displayed in the Supplementary.
    
  - [:file\_folder: **SM_Tables**](SM_Tables/) directory contains the tables displayed in the Supplementary.
   
  - [:file\_folder: **SM_Final_figures**](SM_Final_figures/) directory contains the tables displayed in the Supplementary.
    
  - [:file\_folder: **Tables**](Tables/) directory contains the tables displayed in the main text.
